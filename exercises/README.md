## Exercises
** OBS! many of the links and the videos points to the 1dv023 organization on GitHub. This the same course as this 1DV523.**

Exercises below are in separate repositories.

The assignments are divided in to separate levels, A, B and C where C is the most difficult level. You should always strive to complete at least level A and B.

As a registred student on the course you should have been given a exercise repo where you can save your solutions. This is up to your self to handle this. The course management will NOT check your exercise repo.
