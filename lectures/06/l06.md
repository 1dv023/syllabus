## Resources
In the following text and demo videos we will go through how to work with our own private cloud. All student will get a own virtual server to use as a production server for your web application. The severs will be taken down after the examination.

### Getting your SSH key and connect to your server
To log into your server you will need a SSH key and connect though SSH. Since the server you will connect to is a Ubuntu server there will be no graphical interface and all the configuration will be done through the terminal. If you running MacOS or Linux you should be able to use the terminal. If you are on Windows you should use the Git-bash program that should have support for SSH.

The first thing you do is to go to the [Cloud info page](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/server-based-web-programming/cloud-info/) on the course page. You must be logged into CoursePress (use your student account) to se your private link. Download your SSH keypair to your local computer and remember your IP-address. Unzip the keypair-files. You probably have two, one .ppk and one .pem. It is the latest we should use when connecting to the server.

### Some Linux resources
If you feel the need of learning more about Linux (commands, tools, bash scripting and so on) there is a learning object available: https://github.com/CS-LNU-Learning-Objects/linux 


### Installing Node.js on your server
In this video we will install Node.js and npm on a Ubuntu 18.04
