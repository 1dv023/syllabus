## Demo videos
In these videos I am going to set up a web socket application at Digital Ocean. Of course you can choose other providers but since you got free virtual hosting (for a while) through the [github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/) I am going to use this provider through out these videos. To follow along please create a account at Digital Ocean and use the promotion code from GitHub.

In the first video we start by creating the server. We will use a preinstalled droplet for this so we donÂ´t have to install some part manually.

In the next part we set up the server to be able to listen for git pushes. That way we can push our code to the production server the same way we push it to GitHub.

Next it is time to install a process manager that help us with running our node application.

A demo movie about creating self-signed HTTPS certificates (same as in the web security lecture) and running your application with HTTPS. Later on (in the last video) your Nginx will be handle the HTTPS.

In the last video we sets up a Nginx web server as an reversed proxy. We also let the Nginx handle all request to static files hand taking care of the encryption and decryption needed for running HTTPS.
